This folder contains a **broken** first-pass attempt at reproducing figure 4 of the 
original paper. 

We had originally planned to reproduce this as part of our project,
but did not end up with sufficient time to debug and figure out what we're 
doing incorrectly. (The script that's here produces results that don't make
sense.) 

We're leaving one of our attempts here for transparency and in case anyone 
knows what we were doing wrong!
